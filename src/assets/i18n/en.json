      "My Enthusiasm for the diversity of human Expression has shaped my personal and professional Development. From an early age, I observed people around me as they captured the Attention of the Audience. At the end of my carpentry Apprenticeship, I built a Lectern as my journeyman's Piece. With this I expressed my Passion for Communication and Language and became a speech Therapist and an Actress."
